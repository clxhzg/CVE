In the function GetParentControlInfo, the program takes the contents obtained from the parameter 'mac' and passes them to the heap block s created by the program, 
then directly copies the value of mac to the heap s using the strcpy function. 
There is no size check, which leads to a stack overflow vulnerability. An attacker can easily carry out a denial of service attack using carefully crafted overflow data.
