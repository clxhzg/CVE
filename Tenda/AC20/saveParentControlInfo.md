In the function saveParentControlInfo, the program passes the content obtained from the parameter "deviceId" to the heap block s created by the program, and then directly copies the value of deviceId into the heap s using the strcpy function. There is no size check, which leads to a stack overflow vulnerability. An attacker can easily execute a denial-of-service attack using carefully crafted overflow data.
