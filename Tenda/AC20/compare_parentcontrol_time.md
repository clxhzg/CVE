In the function compare_parentcontrol_time, the program retrieves content from the parameter 'time' and passes it to the variable s created by the program, with the variable's value being passed via scanf. There is no size check, which leads to a stack overflow vulnerability. An attacker can easily execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service attack using carefully crafted overflow data.
